C++-Tests
=========

Code examples for my course "Clean Code and Tests with C++".

Some libraries are cloned as git submodules. To check out the repository and
all its submodules do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/hoelzl/CleanCodeCpp.git
    cd CleanCodeCpp
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive

All files written by me (Matthias HÃ¶lzl) are licensed under the terms of the MIT
